What's this
============

It's a helper library for Groovy, containing a supplement of standard API,
a proposal of new features and so on.

Current features:

@Equiv
    If you annotate specified fields, you can dynamically generate the equals
    method and the hashCode method.

String.tr()
    tranlation of each character in String

Object.tap()
    tap methods for iterator


Requirements
============

To use you will need:

    - Groovy: 1.7+ (http://groovy.codehaus.org/)

To build you will need:

    - JDK 6+ (http://java.sun.com/j2se/)
    - Gradle 0.8+ (http://www.gradle.org/)


Download
============

Download from the following:

    - http://sourceforge.net/projects/kobo-dist/files/


Install
============

Just add "kobo-commons-<VERSION>.jar" you downloaded to a classpath of your products.


How to use
============

@Equiv
--------------

If you wrote the following groovy code:

    static class Sample {
        @Equiv
        String name

        @Equiv
        String value

        String ignored
    }

then you could use equals method and hashCode method:

    def s1 = new Sample(name:'John', value:'Good', ignored:'Garbage')
    def s2 = new Sample(name:'John', value:'Good', ignored:'Gold')
    def s3 = new Sample(name:'John', value:'Bad',  ignored:'Garbage')
    def s4 = new Sample(name:'Mike', value:'Good', ignored:'Garbage')
    
    assert s1 == s1
    assert s1 == s2
    assert s1 != s3
    assert s1 != s4
    
    assert s1.hashCode() == s1.hashCode()
    assert s1.hashCode() == s2.hashCode()
    assert s1.hashCode() != s3.hashCode()
    assert s1.hashCode() != s4.hashCode()

To build everything, run tests and create a complete installation:

    gradle test install

To build without running tests:

    gradle install
